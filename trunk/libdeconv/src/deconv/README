About:

	This is the README for the LSDCAS software package. In it are some basic instructions
	for installing the deconv library and software, released under the terms of GPL.
    	A copy of the license accompanies this software in the file COPYING.

Requirements Checklist:

	A working installation of a recent Linux distro, or (on Mac OS/X) properly installed Developer Tools 
	(available at http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/).
	
INSTALLATION

NOTE: If you follow along with the Ubuntu Dapper installation instructions, you'll have to make sure
that the universe sources are uncommented in /etc/apt/sources.list

==========================
1. Setup build environment
==========================

For those not using Ubuntu, you need at minimal, gcc/g++, scons, and subversion to get the software.
Building your own compiler is outside the scope of this document.  scons and subversion are the only two
nonstandard packages, although subversion is becomming much more standard, and scons is readily availible
from most package repositories.

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential manpages-dev automake1.9 scons subversion

===========================
2. Get some extra libraries
===========================

Extra libraries needed:

	libfftw3 libfftw3f	- FFTW3 Library
	libgslcblas libgsl	- Gnu Science Library
	libglut libGL libGLU	- GL Library, only if you plan on installing viewers

$ sudo apt-get libboost-dev 
$ sudo apt-get fftw3 fftw3-dev fftw3-doc 
$ sudo apt-get libgsl0 libgsl0-dbg libgsl0-dev gsl-bin gsl-doc-pdf gsl-ref-html gsl-ref-psdoc 
$ sudo apt-get freeglut3 freeglut3-dbg freeglut3-dev libglut3 libglut3-dev libglew1
$ sudo apt-get libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dri

==================
3. Building deconv
==================

Get sources from the repository:

$ svn co http://svn.lsdcas.engineering.uiowa.edu/repos/lsdcas/trunk/deconv
$ cd deconv

Build all in the "/usr/local/" directory: (default, make sure that you have the permission)
 
$ scons
$ sudo scons install

Build all in the current directory:

$ scons Local=1
$ sudo scons install

Build libdeconv and its utilities only in the "/usr/local/" directory:

$ scons LibOnly=1
$ sudo scons install

Build libdeconv and its utilities only in the current directory:

$ scons Local=1 LibOnly=1
$ sudo scons install

If you get errors while the software is building, try using:

$ scons -h

To get a list of all the possible build options. Most likely, a required library is installed somewhere other
than expected.  This is common for libraries you may have built locally.

==========================
4. Update ld configuration
==========================

Chances are, if you got too excited and tried running one of the programs,
you recieved an error about not being able to find the shared libraries.  
This is because ld (dynamic linker) doesn't know where to locate 'libdeconv'.

There are two easy fixes for this.

The first, is to set the following environment variable in your ~/.bash_profile

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib (if you install 'deconv' in the default mode)
or
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:the_path_of_libdeconv (if you install 'deconv' using 'Local=1' )

To make this configuration system wide you can do the following:

$ sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf

This may or may not be an empty file.  The format is a single directory entry per line.

Regardless, just add to the end of the file with
'/usr/local/lib' (if you install 'deconv' in the default mode)
or
'the_path_of_libdeconv' (if you install 'deconv' using 'Local=1')

Now all you need is one last command to inform ld of its new configuration

$ sudo ldconfig

Now you should be able to enjoy using the LSDCAS Software.
